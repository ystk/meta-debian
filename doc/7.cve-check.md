# CVE Check feature

The CVE check feature is based on Poky's CVE check functionality and uses NVD vulnerability information. However, the fixed versions listed in NVD vulnerability information may not match Debian package versions. As a result, relying solely on NVD vulnerability information could lead to Debian packages that have already been patched being mistakenly identified as unpatched. To address this issue, the CVE check feature in meta-debian utilizes Debian vulnerability information to eliminate false positives.

# Variable

- DEBIAN\_SECRUTY\_TRACKER\_JSON\_URL

Debian 10 reached the end of LTS support in June 2024 and has been maintained as ELTS by Freexian since July 2024. Therefore, vulnerability information for Debian packages is sourced from the data provided by Freexian. However, retrieving vulnerability information from this server may sometimes fail, preventing the CVE check from being performed.

To address this issue, users can now configure a mirror server to be used when downloading vulnerability information from Freexian's server fails. The ```DEBIAN_SECURITY_TRACKER_JSON_URL``` variable is set by default to Freexian's server URL, but users can modify its value or add additional URLs as needed. This setting can be in conf/local.conf or other file.

Append URL:

```
DEBIAN_SECRUTY_TRACKER_JSON_URL_append = " http://localhost:8000/dst.json"
```

Replace URL:

```
DEBIAN_SECRUTY_TRACKER_JSON_URL = "http://localhost:8000/dst.json"
```
